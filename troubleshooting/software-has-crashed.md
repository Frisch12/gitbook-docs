Otherwise, if the software can start properly, but crashes during operation, this article can offer some potential solutions below.

### **Common Solutions**

Please try the following solutions first before contacting support.

* Test the [latest version of the Saleae software](https://www.saleae.com/downloads)
* Remove all active protocol analyzers
  * This solution may help when the software crashes immediately after the Start button is clicked, and might indicate a buggy protocol analyzer.
* Remove unused channels
* Disable 'Decoded Protocol Search' \(Options -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Capture Tab\)
* Run the Logic software as administrator
* Delete the settings.xml file. It may be corrupt. See instructions below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you can find and delete settings.xml, make the file visible first.

* On Windows - Showing hidden files and folders should be enabled. [Instructions Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files)
* On OSX - Showing the Library folder should be enabled. [Instructions Here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8137224?answerId=8137224021#8137224021)
{% endhint %}

The settings.xml file can be located below.

### **Contacting Support**

When [contacting support](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), please include the following information.

* Results of the tests under 'Common Solutions' above
* Saleae Logic software version \(found in the software title bar\)
* The operating system used, the version of OS, and if it is 32-bit or 64-bit.

    On Linux, also include the kernel version "uname -r" and the name of the window manager if it's not stock.

* Which product\(s\) you were using when the software crashed
* The USB host controllers installed in your computer

    On Windows, open Device Manager and expand the section "Universal Serial Bus Controllers." Send a screenshot of the contained items or a listing of all host controllers found in the list.

    On Linux, pipe the output of "lspci" to a file.

    This can be skipped on OSX, which exclusively uses Intel series host controllers.

* If you are unable to capture with a device, please test the device on another computer.
* Indicate if this is a new problem or if you have always experienced this problem when using the Logic software.
* Describe what you were doing when the crash/bug occurred.

    Did it occur at the beginning / during / after a capture?

    Is the crash/bug repeatable? If so, what are the steps leading up to the crash?

* Include a zipped copy of the error reports on your computer. They can be found below.
