# Publish an Extension

Publishing your extension to the Saleae Marketplace will make it viewable and installed by our community of logic analyzer users. With your help, we're hoping to make several more extensions readily available, both from us and from our users!

Before publishing, you will need to have an extension finished and ready to share. You can follow along with our Extensions Quickstart guide below as a starting point.

{% page-ref page="extensions-quickstart.md" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Publishing an extension is not yet available in the latest Logic 2.x software. We will update this notice and this guide once it's ready. Note that publishing your extension will make it installable for anyone who uses the Logic software.
{% endhint %}

1. Once your extension is ready, click 'Publish.'
