# USB-C Cable Recommendations



There are a few USB-C to Micro-USB-3.0 cables that we have confirmed work well with our products. These cables can be especially handy when connecting Logic to a laptop that only have USB-C connectors available. Here is a list below:

Although we have only tested a limited pool of cables, there is a high chance that any USB-C to Micro cable will work, as long as it is purchased from a reputable manufacturer.
